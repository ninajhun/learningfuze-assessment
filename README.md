# LearningFuze Instructor Assignment

This repo includes the material for my lesson on **Let and Const**. This is intended to be a flipped classroom assignment.

1. The student will read the [lesson](https://github.com/ninajhun/learningfuze-assessment/blob/main/let-and-const/LESSON.md) beforehand and then come to the class to dicuss it. 

2. In the class, we will:
    - review the lesson by filling in the [table of differences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PXHPPsTu4fC2YfeGxy0jlTg1qlAV507zabkuLtYfMWY/edit?usp=sharing). 
    - go over the lesson questions + [answers](https://github.com/ninajhun/learningfuze-assessment/blob/main/let-and-const/ANSWERS.md)
    - do [live coding assignment](https://github.com/ninajhun/learningfuze-assessment/blob/main/let-and-const/exercise.js) where we convert var to const/let.
