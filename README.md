## ES6 - Move over Var: Let and Const are now in town 

## 1: A Review of Var 

### What is Scope? 

- Simply put, Scope means <b> where a variable can be called for use. </b> 

### What is Var's Scope? 
- Global and function/locally scoped
- The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.
- var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.
